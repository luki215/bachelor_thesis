Nowadays services like Uber start to surpass taxi companies in comfort of transport. 
In this thesis, we create a back-end part of an application for taxi companies in smaller towns. 
This application provides an interface for creating and managing orders, employees, 
customers, and vehicles. As part of the system, we constructed order scheduler 
which calculates the order duration, estimated time of arrival and distributes 
the order between available drivers automatically. Overall the application increases 
the taxi company's efficiency and offers users a more comfortable experience.
