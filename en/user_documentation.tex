\chapter{API documentation}
Our application communicates with the front-end applications via the REST API. As described in the technical analysis we decided to use the \textit{Apiary} for our documentation. The documentation is available at the \url{https://taxiali.docs.apiary.io/}.

Besides that the documentation is also available in the standardized \textit{API Blueprint} format \footnote{\url{https://apiblueprint.org/}}.
located in \textit{/api\_documentation.apib}.
